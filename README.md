# IXIS-Data-Science-Challenge

# In this code is my completed IXIS Data Science Challenge in R that includes a Month*Device aggregation along with a two most recent month data table that
# includes most recent value, previous month value, absolute difference between the two, and relative difference between the two. 
# I had trouble with the openxlsx part of the code. I have never used R to create an excel file so I'm not sure if the workbooks will actually be created.
# This is a small step that can be easily fixed with a small amount of experience and practice.
